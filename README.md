# Tube-Bricks
Tube Bricks is a simple to use text generator for YouTube. Add text bricks, separators and start mixing them to create the desciption for your next YouTube video.

## Bricks
Bricks are one of the main components of this App. Every Brick has a title and the text itself. Titels are used to organise and find your bricks. The list on the left side is searchable so you can find and edit a specific brick quicker. The text of the brick is used to generate the description in the Generator tab.

## Separators
Separators are the other main component of this App. Every Separator also has a title and a text. Titels are again used to organise them and the list of separators are searchable as well. The purpose of separators is, that in the generator each brick is simply concatenated to the generated description. A separator separates each brick from each other. You can for example create a separator to get a line break, a double line break or anything you can imagine to separate your bricks.

## Generator
Here your bricks and separators come to life. Add your bricks, chose a separator for each brick and generate your description. There are also two textfields for freetext, the header and the footer. Each separator is inserted right after the brick or the header. Only the separator for the footer is inserted between the last brick and the text for the footer. Once you click generate, the generated text is copied to your pastebord.
